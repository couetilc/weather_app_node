# Weather Forecast, with node.js

Clone of [my other repository](https://github.com/couetilc/take-home-interview_Jan-2023_apple),
but instead of Ruby on Rails, I'm using node.js. I must prove I have skillz that killz.

## Plan

- let's forget the database for now, and the proxy, but let's get Redis configured
- docker compose and cli.sh, ok let's do it.
- we'll try tRPC? Why not, just check it out for now
- Typescript will be used, eslint will be configured with some default settings
- Need a good CSS solution for extracting stylesheets ala svelte
- Playwright e2e testing
- will ask Dave if he wants me to add any features before 1PM tomorrow, whatever
  he wants, I will implement.
